# Topeka for Android

A fun to play quiz that showcases material design on Android

### Introduction

Material design is a rational approach to visual, interaction and motion design
across platforms. We originally launched the [Topeka web app](https://github.com/Polymer/topeka) as an open-source example of material design on the web.

The Android version of Topeka demonstrates that the same branding and material
design principles can be used to create a consistent experience across
platforms. **TODO: LINK TO ARTICLE**
